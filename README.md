The housing management system is a web application that manages societies and its houses, with all the member details assigned to each house. This application provides platform to the society to register on the system, and there are many houses according to each society. Each house is allocated to the owner of the house and all the owners are members of the project. After becoming a member, they can login to give their house on rent or to sell. Users can easily find a house to rent or buy in the society and get the contact information of the owner of the house by visiting the website. Members can also make online complaints related to their homes on the housing management system.
In this housing management system, the society is categorized by the number of houses. The people residing in these houses may either be the owner or tenant of the house. In this era, people are very busy with their routine work giving them very little time the file small complaints related to their houses. To solve this, a system was developed allowing members to make complaints anywhere and anytime.
In this housing management system, there are three types of users namely, admin, member of the website and the outside users who are looking to rent or buy a house i.e., the guest users.
